# 🎯 Portfolio Website

> A modern portfolio website that doesn't just look good—it performs like a Formula 1 car and is more accessible than a public library.

Built with Next.js 15, Three.js, and an unhealthy obsession with performance metrics.

## ✨ What Makes This Special

This isn't your typical "throw React at everything" portfolio. It's a carefully engineered showcase that demonstrates:

- **Performance Engineering**: Sub-500KB bundle sizes with intelligent code splitting
- **3D Web Graphics**: Three.js integration that doesn't tank your frame rate
- **Accessibility First**: WCAG compliant with automated testing
- **Modern Architecture**: Next.js 15 App Router with TypeScript throughout
- **Animation Mastery**: GSAP + Locomotive Scroll for buttery smooth interactions
- **DevOps Mindset**: Comprehensive audit system with automated performance monitoring

## 🚀 Tech Stack

**Frontend Powerhouse**

- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- TypeScript (strict mode, because we're not animals)
- Tailwind CSS v4 (utility-first styling)
- Three.js + React Three Fiber (3D graphics)
- GSAP (scroll animations)
- Locomotive Scroll (smooth scrolling)

**Performance & Quality**

- Custom webpack optimization
- Bundle analyzer integration
- Lighthouse CI/CD
- Jest + React Testing Library
- ESLint + TypeScript compiler
- Automated accessibility auditing

**Infrastructure**

- Vercel deployment
- EmailJS contact integration
- Image optimization (WebP/AVIF)
- Security headers & CSP

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone <your-repo>
cd portfolio-website
npm install

# Start development (with Turbopack for speed)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## 🔧 Development Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start with Turbopack
npm run build           # Production build
npm run start           # Production server

# Testing & Quality
npm test                # Run test suite
npm run test:coverage   # Coverage report
npm run lint            # ESLint check

# Performance Auditing
npm run audit:all       # Complete audit suite
npm run perf:audit      # Performance check
npm run audit:a11y      # Accessibility audit
npm run build:analyze   # Bundle analysis
```

## 📊 Performance Standards

This project maintains strict performance standards:

- **Bundle Size**: < 500KB first load JS
- **Core Web Vitals**: LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, FCP < 1.8s
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance
- **Test Coverage**: > 80% (because 100% is for show-offs)

## 🎨 Architecture Highlights

**Smart Loading Strategy**

- Hero section loads immediately (first impressions matter)
- Below-the-fold sections are dynamically imported
- Three.js chunks are split separately to avoid blocking

**Performance Monitoring**

- Real-time Core Web Vitals logging in development
- Automated bundle size warnings
- Accessibility issue detection
- Lighthouse integration for CI/CD
